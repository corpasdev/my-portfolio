Astro and UI components.

- Components should be reusable and self-contained.
- Use typed props with TypeScript.
- Implement scoped styling for each component.
- Use `@apply` in `.css` for reusable utility styles.
- Avoid redundant or excessive Tailwind class usage.
- Apply smooth animations using `transition`, `duration`, `ease-in-out`.
- Colors, typography, and spacing should come from `tailwind.config.js`.
- Ensure accessibility: use `aria-label`, `alt`, and maintain proper color contrast.
